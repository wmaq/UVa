In an ancient village there lived a number of people
who liked different sorts of sports very much.
But there was no built-in sports-ground. So
they started looking for places. Ultimately what
they found were the surfaces of the rocks with
a shape of a regular polygon. Since the spectators
are the part and parcel of the game, they
must have some place over the ground. Again,
officials of the teams must also have some space.
They chose the in circle or striped portion of the
regular polygon as the playing ground. They
decided to leave the dotted portion as indicated
in the figure for spectators and the criss-crossed
portion for the officials. The diagonally striped
portion is used for playing the game. You are
going to help them to find the area of these portions.
A polygon is regular if all its sides are equal
and all its angles are equal. Either of the conditions
implies the other in the case of a triangle, but not in general. A rhombus has equal sides but not
necessarily equal angles, and a rectangle has equal angles but not necessarily equal sides. So rhombus
and rectangle are not regular polygons.
You are given the area (A) of an n-sided regular polygon. You are to determine the total area for
the spectators and the total area for the officials. Assume that π = 2 ∗ cos−1
(0).
Input
In each line of the input file there is an integer n (0 < n ≤ 50) and a floating-point number A
(0 ≤ A ≤ 30000). A line with the value of n is less than three, terminates the input.
Output
For each line of input (except the last one) you should produce one line of output. This line contains
the serial no of output as shown in the sample output followed by two floating-point numbers separated
by a single space. The first one gives the area for the spectators and the second one gives that of
the officials. There is also a single space between the colon and first floating point number. The
floating-point numbers has five digits after the decimal point.
